# Lib

Lib folder works as the `internal library for the project`, here is where all my application modules belong to and also a `common` module

## Example

```
|-- lib
    |-- order
        |-- data
        |-- actions
        |-- components
        |-- index.ts
    |-- customer
        |-- data
        |-- actions
        |-- components
        |-- index.ts
    |-- common
        |-- hooks
        |-- utils
        |-- components
        index.ts
```
